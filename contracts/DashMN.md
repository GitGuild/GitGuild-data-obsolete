# Dash Masternode Fund

A Dash masternode is both a dividend paying investment, as well as the requirement for voting rights in the Dash network and budget. As a major stakeholder and partner of Dash, the Git Guild should run at least one Dash masternode at any given time.  

# Roles

 + Key Manager

Currently, Dash masternodes are not compatible with multisignature addresses. Therefore, a single key must be used, with at least one person capable of spending the balance of DASH. If many masternodes are run, different keyholders could be selected, to at least distribute the counterparty risk, but it is a singificant problem.

In the mid term, the Dash team is considering adding multisignature support for masternodes, which will allow a more secure key management scheme.

Member isysd is appointed to manage up to 10 masternodes. For processing withdrawals from these, isysd asks for the following fees.

| Activity | Fee | Reason |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Set up MN | 1 DASH | It takes some time even with hosting at node40, and most importantly, the key must be generated and securely stored. |
| Withdraw DASH | 0.01 DASH | Signing a withdrawal takes some small manual effort, at the moment. |
| Withdraw non-DASH | 0.01 DASH + 1% | Conversion takes even more effort. And incurs fees for things like trading, miners, etc. |

### Masternode Voting

As most of the Dash voting happens on less than a month's notice, a small group should be appointed to proxy voting for the Guild. Until that can be done, isysd will perform this duty.

# Economics

### Funding

X000 DASH

The Git Guild Treasury will fund this project from its managed funds, listed in Assets:Treasury.

### ROI

Each Dash masternode costs 1,000 DASH. The expected annual interest from a Dash Masternode is 10,05%, or 100.5 DASH. In the first half of 2016, Dash appreciated 132% in value, from $3.50 to $8.11.

[Node40](http://node40.com) should be used for hosting the masternodes, in the short term. They charge a not cheap 2.74 DASH/mo/mn.
