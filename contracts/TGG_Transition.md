# Transition Agreement

An agreement to transition from Legacy Git Guild coin aka TGG to this guild's new XGG Git Guild coin. By signing this document with your gpg key, you agree to the terms of this agreement.
  
 + Member isysd is appointed interrim Treasury signer. New, and/or additional signers should be voted in as soon as procedures are in place.
 + Any claims from the old Git Guild Bounty system in $ or TGG will be arbitrated by this guild, as normal PRs. That is to say 51% of XP votes will decide any legacy commitment into XGG.  
 + Consent is given to dissolve the TGG colored coin, without any futher signatures or spending of TGG coins. (Some are stuck in hard to access, beta software, multisig wallets)  
 + XGG payments are not immediately redeemable. After any XGG is earned, a separate transaction must be made for redemption, and normal voting procedures are in effect.

If you will not follow the terms of this agreement, contact isysd to initiate private dispute resolution with a mutually agreed upon arbitrator.
