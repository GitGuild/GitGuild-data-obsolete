# GitGuild Charter

This charter is a private contract to cooperate on development of the project, which is hosted in the following git repository.

https://github.com/isysd/gitguild_whitepaper

### Membership

Anyone can apply to collaborate on the project by creating a branch of this data repository, adding your gpg key to the members.csv file, and submitting the result as a PR.

The existing members then vote, and, if the approval threshold (66%) is reached, the PR is merged, accepting you as a member into the guild. Until your key is approved and merged into the keyring, you have no standing or rights to earn XP for contributions.

##### Experience Points (XP)

Experience Points (XP) are earned when a PR contribution is merged into the project. The amount and allocation of XP for each PR must receive the minimum approval threshold before merging.

### Voting

Voting "Yes" is done by merging and gpg signing a vote proposal. Voting "No" is done by merging and gpg signing a corresponding dissent branch. Votes are weighted by XP earned by the signer up to that point in the chain.

##### Vote Table

| Accept Agreement | 51%        | 1 minute          | 3 months       |

### Economics

##### Experience Points (XP)

XP are for reputation and voting. They cannot be transferred. Though they have no monetary value, XP are earned 1:1 with XGG. The exception is 1 XP which is issued to the founding member(s).

XGG Guild Coins are claims against the Treasury. Any member may unilaterally transfer their XGG to another by submitting a signed entry to this ledger. XGG may only be redeemed with fees and vote approval, as specified by the charter.

##### Revenue

At founding, this guild will receive only $1 from the legacy TGG Infrastructure fund. More may be distributed out of this Infrastructure fund, depending on charter update vote passing.

This guild has no direct revenue streams. We suggest that any git guild support this, the intellectual parent guild with a portion of their revenue. Nothing big. One percent (1%) would be generous.
