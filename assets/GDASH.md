# GDASH Asset Definition

Each GDASH represents a claim against the DashMN Guild Treasury. This treasury is instructed to hold Dash and operate Dash masternodes. In this way, GDASH is backed by DASH, but not pegged to it.

### Funding

X DASH

The DashMN Guild Treasury will fund this project from its managed funds, listed in Assets:Treasury.

### Revenues

Each Dash masternode costs 1,000 DASH. The expected annual interest from a Dash Masternode is 10,05%, or 100.5 DASH. In the first half of 2016, Dash appreciated 132% in value, from $3.50 to $8.11.

Any revenue generated after the above fees should be accounted in the ledger as Assets:Treasury balance, backing GDASH.

Due to fees and revenue, GDASH may be worth more or less than 1 DASH over time.

### Fees

The following maximum fees are approved. Note that these are absolute maximums reflecting initial high-cost procedures. Automation and economies of scale should bring these down.

| Activity | Fee | Reason |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Set up MN | 1 DASH | It takes some time even with hosting at node40, and most importantly, the key must be generated and securely stored. |
| Host a MN | 2.75 DASH/mo | [Node40](http://node40.com) should be used for hosting the masternodes, in the short term. |
| Withdraw DASH | 0.01 DASH | Signing a withdrawal takes some small manual effort, at the moment. |
| Withdraw non-DASH | 0.01 DASH + 1% | Conversion takes even more effort. And incurs fees for things like trading, miners, etc. |
