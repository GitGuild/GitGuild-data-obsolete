# Git Guild Coins

XGG Guild Coins are claims against the Treasury. The usual way XGG is created is by earning XP. XGG are earned 1:1 with XP.

XGG may be issued for reasons other than earning, without XP. For istance, XGG issued as a reimbursement for expenses do not deserve XP. These cases are voted on individually.

### Roles

 + Member
 + Service Provider

All Git Guild members are peers in the XGG network. Any member may unilaterally transfer their XGG to another by submitting a signed entry to the ledger. Members may redeem earned XGG at a penalty of 1% per day from the day of the request, subject to fees and availability.

##### Member Withdrawal Table

To help explain the member withdrawals, this actuary table shows the expected yield assuming a hypothetical XGG price of 1 chicken (CHKN).

| Days since request | Penalty | XGG Redeemed | Yield |
|--------------------|---------|--------------|-------|
| 0 | 100% | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 99% | 1 | 0.01 |
| 2 | 98% | 1 | 0.02 |
| 3 | 97% | 1 | 0.03 |
| n (< 100) | (100 - n)% | 1 | n / 100 |
| 100 | 0% | 1 | 1 |

Service Providers are outside of the Git Guild, and unable to receive payment in XGG. As such, they are not subject to time penalties, and may receive Treasury withdrawals immediately.

### Foundation

The Treasury for this guild can be represented by a legal Git Guild Foundation that will follow the instructions and votes that are processed by this Proof of Labor chain. The guild has contracted a lawyer who has already registered the foundation and is writing the bylaws to match or upgrade this charter.

Until the Git Guild Foundation is needed to take control of any traditional Treasury funds, members from the community should be voted in to perform key signing duties, with 90% approval required.

### Funds

Funds may be established by contract, to hold assets on behalf of the Treasury. These may elect cosigners to manage assets only with 90% approval, as per the Change Treasury Sign Policy.

Funds may charge up to 1% for withdrawal processing.

### Revenue

At founding, this guild received only $1 from the legacy TGG Infrastructure fund. More may be distributed out of this Infrastructure fund, depending on charter update vote passing.

The legacy TGG Infrastructure fund transferred the Dash masternode at [Xh4GuTaGPZ9Rtjqm2ME1dY2g8toGhvWJdH](https://explorer.dash.org/address/Xh4GuTaGPZ9Rtjqm2ME1dY2g8toGhvWJdH) along with 1003.92 DASH. This sets a new XGG price of $1.14445 as of Sept. 8 2016.

This guild has no direct revenue streams. We suggest that any git guild support XGG, the coin of the intellectual parent guild with a portion of their revenue. Nothing big. One percent (1%) converted to [Dash](https://dash.org) and sent to the address above would be generous.
