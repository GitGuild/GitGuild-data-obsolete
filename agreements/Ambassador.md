# Git Guild Ambassador Agreement

An Ambassador is an official envoy, a diplomat to represent a guild. The Ambassador should have a high reputation within the guild, and demonstrate in depth knowledge about the guild's projects.

### Election

Ambassadors must apply by changing their membership status from `active` to `ambassador`. This indicates to the other members their desire to change status within the guild. The voting keyword `ambassador` is reserved to set the threshold for election of an Ambassador. Members may demote an existing Ambassador by changing their membership status back to `active`. Any block that the member is below the threshold, they are not an Ambassador, and vice versa.

### Responsibilities

Ambassadors are representatives of their guild, and should be an example of the organization's standards and ethics. Their primary responsibility is as an envoy to open up sponsorship opportunities and recruit qualified members to the guild.

### Abilities

Ambassadors may speak on behalf of the guild, including in public settings such as conferences and to the press. Ambassadors may make preliminary agreements, which may only be executed by a member vote. Finally, Ambassadors may ask for guild-related expenses to be re-imbursed.
